CrossOver
===============

This shiny app calculates the perceptual boundary in a phoneme 
identification experiment. You can adjust the parameter estimates of the 
model and see how the perceptual boundary is updated in real time. The app 
uses the function `crossOver` and gives the calculation in ms.
